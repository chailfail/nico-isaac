Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to use an API to get lyrics from the internet, all for the goal of making a guessing
game. We wanted to allow users to guess different lyrics from songs they listen to, as well as automate the song
selection process. Ultimately this project is for the pursuit of fun!

Approach:
We used two different APIs, the Spotify API and the Genius API. While doing research we discovered that there were
pre-established libraries which could help us utilize our chosen APIs. I used the lyricsgenius library, which allowed
me to search for an artists songs and lyrics. Nico used the Spotify API, which allowed him to retrieve a user's
most listened to artists. Nico also used the OAuth library to authenticate contact between the server and our program.
